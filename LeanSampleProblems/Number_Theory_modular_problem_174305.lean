For a 22-digit number $z$, the following properties are required:
$z$ has the unit digit 7; if this last digit is removed and placed in front of the remaining 21 digits, the result is the same as the multiplication $7 \cdot z$.
Prove that there is exactly one such number $z$! Determine this number! -/

  -- Note: This can be solved by `omega`, but we provide human reasoning steps.
